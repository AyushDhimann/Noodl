# üîå API Endpoint Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to all available API endpoints for the Noodl backend.

## üë§ User Endpoints

Endpoints for managing user profiles and their created content.

---

### Create or Update a User
- **Endpoint:** `POST /users`
- **Description:** Creates a new user or updates an existing one. This endpoint uses checkpoint logic: it will only fill in `name` or `country` if they are currently empty for an existing user, preventing accidental overwrites of existing data. If the user does not exist, a new record is created with all provided details.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "wallet_address": "0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B",
    "name": "Alice",
    "country": "USA"
  }
  ```
- **Success (201 Created):** Returns the full user object (either newly created or existing, potentially updated).
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "wallet_address": "0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b",
    "name": "Alice",
    "country": "USA",
    "created_at": "2025-06-14T12:00:00.000000+00:00"
  }
  ```
- **Error (400 Bad Request):** If `wallet_address` is missing.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "wallet_address is required"
  }
  ```
- **Error (500 Internal Server Error):** If the database operation fails.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Failed to create or update user."
  }
  ```

### Complete a Path & Mint NFT
- **Endpoint:** `POST /paths/<path_id>/complete`
- **Description:** Initiates the minting process for an NFT certificate. The path must be fully completed by the user before this can be called. This endpoint handles:
    1. Verifying path completion.
    2. Checking if NFT already minted (DB & Blockchain).
    3. Generating certificate image (if not cached locally).
    4. Uploading image to IPFS.
    5. Uploading metadata JSON (including image IPFS URL) to IPFS.
    6. Minting the NFT on the blockchain (first transaction).
    7. Saving NFT details to the database.
    8. Setting the token URI on the minted NFT (second transaction).
- **URL Parameters:**
  - `path_id` (integer, required): The ID of the learning path.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "user_wallet": "0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B"

  - If Blockchain check shows NFT already minted: `{"error": "Certificate has already been minted.", "detail": "The blockchain confirms..."}`
- **Error (500 Internal Server Error):** If any step in the multi-stage minting process fails. The `detail` field will provide more context.
  ```json

    "error": "NFT minting failed.", // Generic error
    "detail": "The server's wallet has insufficient funds to pay for gas." // Example specific detail
  }
  ```
  Other details include: "Failed to generate NFT image.", "Failed to upload certificate image to IPFS.", "Failed to upload metadata to IPFS.", "Minting failed, did not receive a Token ID.", "Minting succeeded but failed to save record to DB...", "Minting succeeded and DB record saved, but failed to set metadata URL on blockchain."
