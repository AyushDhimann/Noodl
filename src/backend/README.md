Welcome to the Noodl backend, a powerful and robust engine for a next-generation, AI-driven educational platform. This project provides a complete server-side solution, from dynamic, on-the-fly course creation to immutable, on-chain proof of completion via NFTs.

The core philosophy is to leverage cutting-edge AI to create high-quality, structured learning paths for any topic imaginable, and to use Web3 technology to bring verifiable ownership and achievement to the learning process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Content Engine
- **Dynamic Title & Description Generation**: Automatically transforms a simple user query (e.g., "learn python") into an engaging, SEO-friendly course title (`üêç Python Programming: From Zero to Hero`) and a compelling description.
- **Adaptive Curriculum Design**: The AI analyzes the complexity of the topic to generate a syllabus with an appropriate number of lessons‚Äîfewer for simple topics, more for complex ones.
- **Rich, Interleaved Content**: Each lesson is a rich mix of detailed, markdown-formatted slides and interactive multiple-choice quizzes to reinforce learning.
- **Reliable AI Interaction**: Implements a robust retry mechanism for API calls to handle transient network issues and ensure content generation completes successfully.

### üîó Web3 & Blockchain Integration
- **Immutable Proof-of-Creation**: A unique hash of every learning path's content is registered on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a tamper-proof, verifiable record of the curriculum at the time of creation.
- **On-Chain NFT Certificates**: Upon successful completion of a path, users are awarded a unique, AI-generated SVG-based NFT certificate, minted directly to their wallet. This serves as a permanent, transferable proof of achievement.

### üöÄ Robust Backend Architecture
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Long-running processes like AI content generation are handled in background threads, providing an immediate response to the user and allowing them to poll for status updates.
- **Persistent Task Logging**: Generation progress is logged to a database, ensuring that status updates can be retrieved even if the server restarts.
- **Atomic Operations & Cleanup**: The system is designed to be atomic. If any part of the multi-step generation process fails, all partially created data (database records, etc.) is automatically rolled back, preventing orphaned data.
- **Secure & Modular Routes**: The API is organized into logical, secure blueprints (Users, Paths, Progress, NFTs) for clarity and maintainability.

### üíª Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive Testing UI**: Comes with a pre-built, aesthetic Gradio UI that provides a full suite of tools to test every single API endpoint without needing a separate frontend application.
- **Extensive Configuration**: Application behavior can be easily modified via environment variables, including feature flags to toggle major functionalities like blockchain registration or duplicate checking.
- **Detailed Documentation**: This README provides a complete guide to setup, architecture, and every available API endpoint.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Noodl backend up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) & `venv`
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for the database.
- A [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) account for a Gemini API Key.
- An [Infura](https://infura.io/) account for an Ethereum RPC URL.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet with Sepolia test ETH.

### 2. Initial Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AyushDhimann/DuoLingo
    cd DuoLingo/src/backend/
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`. Fill in all required values.

```env
# .env
FLASK_APP=main.py
FLASK_DEBUG=True

# --- APIs and Services ---
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

### 4. Database Setup
1.  In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to **Database** > **Extensions**.
2.  Search for and enable `vector`.
3.  Go to the **SQL Editor**, paste the entire content of `database/schema.sql`, and run the query. This script is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely.

### 5. Smart Contract Deployment
1.  Open the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2.  Create and paste the content of the `.sol` files from the `contracts/` directory.
3.  Compile both contracts using a `0.8.20` (or compatible) compiler version.
4.  Connect your MetaMask wallet (on Sepolia network).
5.  Deploy `LearningPathRegistry.sol`.
6.  Deploy `NoodlCertificate.sol`, providing your wallet address as the `initialOwner`.
7.  Copy the deployed contract addresses into your `.env` file.
8.  From the "Solidity Compiler" tab in Remix, copy the ABI for each contract and save them as `LearningPathRegistry.json` and `NoodlCertificate.json` inside the `contracts/` directory.
